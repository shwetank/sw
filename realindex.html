    <p>This playSound() function could be called every time somebody presses a key or clicks something with the mouse.</p>

  <p>The start(time) function makes it easy to schedule precise sound playback for games and other time-critical applications. However, to get this scheduling working properly, ensure that your sound buffers are pre-loaded. (On older systems, you may need to call noteOn(time) instead of start(time).)</p>

  <p>An important point to note is that on iOS, Apple currently mutes all sound output until the first time a sound is played during a user interaction event - for example, calling playSound() inside a touch event handler. You may struggle with Web Audio on iOS "not working" unless you circumvent this - in order to avoid problems like this, just play a sound (it can even be muted by connecting to a Gain Node with zero gain) inside an early UI event - e.g. "touch here to play".</p>
